# Regional-Porosity-Prediction

1 - Run feature extraction on the melt pool images with feature extraction code in ATLAS pipeline
2 - Run binFeatures.py in here
3 - You must have binarised and binned your CT image into voxels (CT repo)
4 - Register the features and label data using the registration notebook
5 - Model contained in ML_model notebook 

Note that whilst some of the binning routines etc. in here are useful, the registration and machine learning is extremely primitive.
